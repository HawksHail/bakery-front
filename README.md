## About

This is the frontend of my Academy Enablement capstone project. 
The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/GenC-EESept21/zion-mantey-project).

This is an e-commerce website for an imaginary bakery. 
There is a category page that allows customers to view all the different types of products with links that bring them to the individual category. There is also a page that lists all the products available. Once customers add items to their cart, they can view and remove items on the Cart page. If they are satisfied with their selection, they can check out which will add the cart to their order history.
